# Problem Description

Many healthcare organizations rely on outdated systems for managing their human resources and medical data. This leads to several critical issues that impact efficiency, security, and decision-making processes.

## Current System Limitations

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Excel-based Management">
        The prevalent use of Excel spreadsheets for HR management, while familiar, introduces significant limitations in data handling and security.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Security Vulnerabilities">
        Excel files are susceptible to unauthorized access, data breaches, and accidental modifications or deletions of critical information.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Limited Collaboration">
        Sharing and co-editing Excel files, especially in large teams or distributed environments, often leads to version control issues and data inconsistencies.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Scalability Issues">
        As employee data volume grows, Excel-based systems become increasingly cumbersome, resulting in performance issues and reduced productivity.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Lack of Role-Based Access Control">
        Excel lacks built-in mechanisms for role-based access control (RBAC), making it difficult to regulate access to sensitive HR reports based on user roles and permissions.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Manual Data Entry and Updates">
        Reliance on manual data entry and updates in Excel is time-consuming and prone to errors, increasing the likelihood of inaccuracies in HR reports.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Limited Reporting Capabilities">
        While Excel provides basic reporting features, generating complex HR reports with advanced filtering, sorting, and visualization capabilities often requires additional tools or manual effort.
