## Project Background/Overview

In today's healthcare organizations, HR departments face unique challenges in managing both administrative and medical aspects of employee data. Many organizations still rely on spreadsheet-based systems, which, while flexible, pose significant limitations in terms of data security, collaboration, and scalability.

HealthStaff Manager emerges as a solution to these challenges, offering a secure, efficient, and collaborative platform that bridges the gap between HR management and healthcare-specific requirements.
